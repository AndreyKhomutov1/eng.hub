# SLISEARCH-3160 consistenf for fresh upgrade - approved
# SLISEARCH-3159 accessible for fresh deploy(we already have health tests, there is no need to make this unit another health test, 
#           good enough that it check the attribute otherwise unit is good)
# SLISEARCH-3158 tracable for customer dataset - ok
# SLISEARCH-3156 Customer dataset - Fast (the parameters should be tied to the einvorment
#      hence they should be in confluence. So we should , this unit should be reworked
#      )
# SLISEARCH-3108 C4 context diagram Search cluster (missed APE, missed commerce console, 
# rename links on Client to Search cluster, )
# SLISEARCH-3114 put in the wrong place move it to correct
# SLISEARCH-3115 

# # Ideas: 
# use some easy yaml tool to generate yaml,
# use my script to update decriptions
# fix the automation to create eng. problems with descriptions 
# integrate the diagram as a rendered object into the architecture documents
# host structurizr internally to ensure we don't loose the data
# process improvement QB - (bi-directional we shouldn't have- error),
# ZBT into the items we spend in jira

# no downloaders - External Data sources
# SLIAO-7534 - ok
# SLIAO-7535 - consistent for search metric, existing test case ok
# SLIAO-7538 - tracable verifying that each query will increase the number we are tracing it by the value
# SLIAO-7536 - fast search metrics - report should load in less then 5 seconds (ok)
# SLIAO-7537 - secure search metrics - check that staff user can see more reports then regular user (ok) 
# SLIAO-7540 - consistent - site traffc metric - checks the cont (ok)

# SLIAO-7472 - ok
# SLIAO-7699 - APE context ( change the description of the APE
